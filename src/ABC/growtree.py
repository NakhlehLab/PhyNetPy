    """
    Returns a birth-death tree. All rates (birth, death, and substitution) may change upon a substitution.
    'b', 'd', and 's' are the initial values of the birth, death, and substitution rates (respectively).
    'goal_leaves' is the amount of leaves the simulated tree should reach before terminating. Thus the tree 
    stops growing when either all lineages go extinct or when it has the same number of leaves as 'goal_leaves'.
    Only extant lineages are present in the final tree. If there are no extant lineages, 'None' will be returned 
    by the function. 'branch_info' is an argument to specify what information is attached to branches. If 
    'branch_info' is 0, the branch length is a variable of the time for that lineage. If 'branch_info' is 1, 
    the branch length is a variable of the number of substitutions that occurred in that lineage. If 'branch_info' 
    is 2, the branch length is a variable of the expected number of substitutions for that lineage. 'shape_b', 
    'shape_d', and 'shape_s' are the shapes of the respective gamma distributions from which each rate is sampled 
    from upon a substitution. 'seq_length' specifies the length of the genetic sequence for the cells 
    (the root will have a randomly generated sequence of length 'seq_length' and subsequent lineages will carry 
    on this sequence, with modifications upon a substitution). Translations from sequence number to sequence can 
    be found in '__seq_dict' (a dictionary populated with 'sequence number : sequence' pairs).
