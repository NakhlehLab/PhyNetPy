    Class that implements accept/reject functionality for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
    There are 2 model objects, one of which is the current state, and the other is the model used to test changes and moves
    to the current accepted version.
    
    Rejection is implemented by reverting the change on the proposed model (like git revert)
    Acceptance is implemented by duplicating the move on the current model (like git merge)
