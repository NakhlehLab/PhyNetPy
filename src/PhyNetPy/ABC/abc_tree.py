def tree_stat(tree_arr, summ_fn):
    """
    Applies function 'summ_fn()' to every element of 'tree_arr' and returns
    the array of results. 'summ_fn()' is a summary function that takes in a single
    tree and returns a numerical value (e.g. tree height, mean branch length,
    colless index). 
    
    Statistics are weighted using 1/SD of the statistic (using the SD of the 
    simulated population). This weighting scheme was chosen based on Schalte et al.
    which describes that a weighted Minkowski distance (weight = 1/SD) is commonly 
    chosen to normalize statistics. 
    
    In ABC-SMC, when going beyond 1 generation, "the distribution of summary statistics 
    in later generations can differ considerably from prior samples" (Schalte et al.). 
    Because of this, adaptive distance functions (i.e. adaptive schemes) given in the 
    ELFI or pyABC packages may be used rather than a simple weighted Minkowski distance. 
    However, this is not necessary for our current implementation, given that we use only 
    1-2 generations in ABC-SMC and the distribution of summary statistics between generations 
    do not vary considerably. This is due to the fact that even from the first generation, 
    the considered simulations are conditioned on the number of goal_leaves, so within the 
    first generation, simulated trees look similar to the "true"/observed tree. In later 
    generations, the simulated trees' distributions of summary statistics may look slightly 
    different from the first generation's distributions, but due to this conditioning on 
    number of leaves, the simulated trees are generally much more homogenous in structure 
    (and thus in calculated statistics) than simulated trees not conditioned on number of leaves. 
    Thus having distributions of summary statistics in later generations that differ considerably 
    from the first generation is not an issue and using an adaptive distance scheme is not necessary.
