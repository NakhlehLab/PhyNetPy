# PhyloGenPy

PhyloGenPy is a Python Library that implements all the capabilities of PhyloNet, but with higher performance algorithms that are built to be more efficient and scalable.
An official release date cannot yet be provided, but any first release will include some basic network inference methods.

To install PhyloGenPy in the future, simply open up a command line instance and execute the following:
`pip install phylogenpy`. Please also download biopython, as some aspects of using PhyloGenPy rely on constructs defined in biopython.
Run `pip install biopython`.

A tutorial and further instructions on how to use PhyloGenPy will be made available on our website, https://nakhlehlab.github.io/.
