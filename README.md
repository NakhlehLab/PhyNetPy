# PhyloPy

PhyloPy is a Python Library that implements all the capabilities of PhyloNet, but with higher performance algorithms that are built to be more efficient and scalable.
An official release date cannot yet be provided, but any first release will include some basic network inference methods.

To install PhyloPy, simply open up a command line instance and execute the following:
`pip install phylopy`. Please also download biopython and beaglepy, as these are dependencies. 
Run `pip install biopython` and `pip install beaglepy`.

A tutorial and further instructions on how to use PhyloPy will be made available on our website, https://nakhlehlab.github.io/.
